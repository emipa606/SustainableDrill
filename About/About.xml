[url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=799382274]Original mod here[/url]

Provides a low yield drill that taps into very deep resource pockets, providing a sustainable means of aquiring resources.

It does not matter where the sustainable drill is placed.

It uses a lot of power, is fairly expensive to make, and requires Deep Drilling research in order to be built.

This is loosely based on TheUbie's deep core miner mod, but pulls resources at a much slower rate and also mines compacted machinery.
